# IntegratedLLM
A lightweight C++ wrapper for embedding LLMs into standalone executables, exposing C-style APIs callable from Python. Built on top of llama.cpp for efficient CPU inference in secure, offline environments.

## **Overview**

The **Integrated LLM** project provides a **lightweight C++ wrapper** that makes it easy to embed **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into **standalone executables**. This framework exposes **C-style APIs** that are callable from **Python**, enabling seamless integration of AI-powered language models in your applications.

Built on top of **llama.cpp**, the project leverages efficient **CPU inference** capabilities, making it suitable for **secure, offline environments** where internet access is not desired. It is ideal for projects where **confidentiality** is a top concern, ensuring that LLMs can be used **internally** without exposing sensitive data to external services.

## **Current Status - Alpha Version (V1.1)** üöß

### **Work in Progress**
The project is currently in **alpha** and is still undergoing various improvements and bug fixes. As part of the ongoing development, we are focused on:
- **Improving inference speed** and overall model performance.
- **Fixing known bugs** and addressing issues in the system.
- **Enhancing the knowledge integration** to allow dynamic updating and retrieval of context for better model outputs.

### **Bug Fixes and Known Issues**
- **Inference Speed**: Currently, the inference may be slow due to ongoing optimizations.
- **Model Output Quality**: Some output may not be as accurate or relevant in certain cases.
- **Error Handling**: We're working on enhancing the robustness of the system to handle edge cases and errors.

For more detailed progress, please refer to the ongoing **V1.1-alpha branch**. Once all issues are resolved, this branch will be merged into the **main branch** for a stable release.
